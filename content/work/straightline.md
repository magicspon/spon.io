This site is a collaboration between [Supple Studios]("http://www.supplestudio.com/") and [Our Name is Mud]("https://ournameismud.co.uk/").

The frontend is built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), with the content being authored in [Craft CMS]("https://craftcms.com"). I used the [CraftQL](https://github.com/markhuot/craftql) plugin, which implements Crafts api as a graphql schema, to take full advange of Gatsby's [graphql](https://graphql.org/) interface.
