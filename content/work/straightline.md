This one is another collaboration between <a href="http://www.supplestudio.com/">Supple Studios</a> and <a href="https://ournameismud.co.uk/">Our Name is Mud</a>. This is the second version of the website.

The site is full of rich media, including audio, podcasts, and video, as well as an extensive catelogue of articles. The site also serves as a platfrom for friends and relativites to request songs for loved ones currently serving time in prison.

The frontend is built using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, with the content being pulled in from a <a href="https://craftcms.com">Craft CMS</a> backend. We used the <a href="https://github.com/markhuot/craftql">CraftQL</a> plugin which allowed us to take advange of Gatsby's <a href="https://graphql.org/">graphql</a> interface.
