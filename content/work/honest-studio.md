The splendid folk over at [Honest Studio](https://www.honeststudio.co.uk/) approach me to see if I could help build their new agency website. Evidently I was more than happy to help!

The authoring requirements were simple enough for me to be able to use [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), which is a great open source CMS ideal for simple static websites. 

I choose [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for the frontend. It's a fantastic tool for creating static websites from [react](https://reactjs.org/) components.

And of course I choose [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the site.
