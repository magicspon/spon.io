The splendid folk over at <a href="https://www.honeststudio.co.uk/">Honest Studio</a> approach me to see if I could help build their new agency website. Evidently I was more than happy to help!

The authoring requirements were simple enough for me to be able to use <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>, which is a great open source CMS ideal for simple static websites. 

I choose <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> for the frontend. It's a fantastic tool for creating static websites from <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a> components.

And of course I choose <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to host the site.
