[Our Name is Mud](https://ournameismud.co.uk/) teamed up with [Our Design Agency](http://our-design-agency.com/) to build this site for global strategy consultants [The Leading Edge](https://theleadingedge.com/).

The frontend was built using Muds internal framework that integrates nicely with [Barba JS](https://barba.js.org/v1/) (a small library for handling page transitions). The backend was built using [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)
