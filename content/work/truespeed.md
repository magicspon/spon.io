Whilst contracting at Creative Design and Branding agency [Mr B & Friends](https://mrbandfriends.co.uk/) I helped build this website for high speed internet providers [Truespeed](https://www.truespeed.com/).

With a new brand in place I was tasked with upgrading their existing [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) to the latest major release. I refactored the frontend codebase using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and my own lightweight javascript framework [@spon/core](https://github.com/magicspon/spon-core/tree/v1). The resulting codebase included a design system and component library, powered by [Fractal](https://fractal.build/), which is seamlessly integrated with the backend system.
