Whilst contracting at Creative Design and Branding agency [Mr B & Friends](https://mrbandfriends.co.uk/) I built this website for high speed internet providers [Truespeed](https://www.truespeed.com/).

With a new brand in place I was tasked with upgrading their existig [Craft CMS]("https://craftcms.com") site to the newly released version 3. I also refactored the frontend codebase using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and my own light weight javascript framework [@spon/core](https://github.com/magicspon/spon-core/tree/v1).
