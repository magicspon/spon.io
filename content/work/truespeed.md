Whilst contracting at Creative Design and Branding agency <a href="https://mrbandfriends.co.uk/">Mr B & Friends</a> I built this website for high speed internet providers <a href="https://www.truespeed.com/">Truespeed</a>.

With a new brand in place I was tasked with upgrading their existig <a href="https://craftcms.com">Craft CMS</a> site to the newly released version 3. I also refactored the frontend codebase using <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> and my own light weight javascript framework <a href="https://github.com/magicspon/spon-core/tree/v1">@spon/core.</a>
