Football! This was an internal project at [Our Name is Mud](https://ournameismud.co.uk/) to celebrate the 2018 World Cup.

We built a bunch of charts and graphics using [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) to illustrate various world cup statistics. We also created a real time voting system with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

It was all put together with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
