This was fun to build! The design champs over at <a href="http://www.supplestudio.com/">Supple Studios</a> created a smashing new brand for PPC agency <a href="https://www.search-star.co.uk">Search Star</a>. 

<a href="https://ournameismud.co.uk/">Our Name is Mud</a> were tasked with building the new website with all the fancy new branding.  This included 100's of animated stars flying all over the shop. A video was used for the home page hero and all of the other arrow's darting about the place, forming various shapes, with built using the canvas API.

The backend is built using the incredible <a href="https://craftcms.com">Craft CMS</a>.
